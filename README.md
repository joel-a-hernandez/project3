Trivia Wars provides users with the opportunity to learn about a handful of different topics: Music, Math, Geography, Sports etc... in a fun and dynamic way. Our app incorporates a classic trivia quiz approach, but also provides users with the choice of either a single player or multiplayer mode. In addition to these different game modes - users can register and keep track of their stats and performance with a live leaderboard and stat tracker on the user page. The live leaderboard tracks user results in both game modes and reflects cumulative performance, which adds a fun competitive element to each game playeed.

 To achieve this balance, we required the use of multiple key technologies; sockiet.io, passport, express, react js, and MongoDB. Through the use of these technologies we were able to implement and weave together our user authorization, live multiplayer gameplay, and user stat storage.
